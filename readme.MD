# Duckduckgo email forwarding address generator

This Python program generates a special email forwarding address that allows you to send emails from your main email account without revealing your real email address to the recipient. The recipient will see your DuckDuckGo email alias as the sender, ensuring your identity remains protected.

## How It Works?

1. Enter your DuckDuckGo email alias.
2. Provide the recipient's email address.
3. The program generates a special email address. You have send email to this special email address from your main email address that you used to sign up for Duckduckgo email protection service


## Why did I make this program?
I created this program because Duckduckgo extenstion doesn't have this feature. It can only generate a new duck email alias. So, you only be able to reply to a person anonymously if they send an email to you in a duck email alias first.
