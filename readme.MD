# Duckduckgo forwarding address generator

This Python program helps you maintain email privacy by using DuckDuckGo email aliases. It generates a special email address that allows you to send emails from your main email account without revealing your real email address to the recipient. The recipient will see your DuckDuckGo email alias as the sender, ensuring your identity remains protected.

## How It Works

Enter your DuckDuckGo email alias.
Provide the recipient's email address.
The program generates a special email address you can use to send emails anonymously through your main email account.
